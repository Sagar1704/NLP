Hurricane
Gert
was
a
large
tropical
cyclone
that
caused
extensive
flooding
throughout
Central
America
and
Mexico
in
September
1993.
It
originated
over
the
southwestern
Caribbean
Sea
and
briefly
attained
tropical
storm
strength
before
crossing
Nicaragua,
Honduras,
and
the
Yucatán
Peninsula.
Once
over
warm
water
in
the
Bay
of
Campeche,
Gert
grew
into
a
Category
2
hurricane
and
made
landfall
on
the
Gulf
Coast
of
Mexico.
The
cyclone
quickly
weakened
to
a
depression
over
the
rugged
terrain
and
eventually
dissipated
over
the
Pacific
Ocean.
Gert's
broad
wind
circulation
produced
heavy
rain
across
Central
America,
flooding
property
and
crops.
Although
the
highest
winds
occurred
upon
landfall
in
Mexico,
the
worst
effects
there
were
due
to
extreme
rainfall
of
31.41
inches
(798
mm)
over
the
mountains.
Following
the
overflow
of
several
rivers,
expansive
parts
of
the
Huasteca
region
became
submerged,
forcing
tens
of
thousands
to
evacuate.
Roads
across
the
affected
countries
were
severely
disrupted,
and
thousands
became
homeless.
The
disaster
killed
116
people,
left
16
missing,
and
caused
$170
million
in
damage
