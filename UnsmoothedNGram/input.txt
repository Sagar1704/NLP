John
J.
Phelan

,
chairman
of
the
Big
Board
,
asserts
that
``
1988
and
1989
have
been
two
of
the
least
volatile
years
in
the
last
30

In

,
American

in
a
new
chief
executive
officer
,
Richard
A.

,
45
,
who
will
remain
as
chairman
,
president

Ralph
T.

,
vice

Orkem
declined
to
give
details
of
its
offer
,
saying
only
that
the
bid
will
be
submitted
for
approval
by
the
board
of
the
British
company
.
But
in
1935
,
when
Congress
was
trying
to
find
someone
or
something
to
blame
for
the
Great
Depression
,
it
decided
to
drop
both
the
secretary
and
the
comptroller
from
the
board
.
Treasury
Undersecretary
David
Mulford
,
for
instance
,
was
at
a
meeting
of
the
Business
Council
in
Hot
Springs
,
Va.
,
when
the
stock
market
fell
,
and
remained
there
through
the
following
day
.
He
will

as

pleaded
innocent
to
the
charges
.
J.
Michael
Cook
,
chairman
of
Deloitte
,
Haskins
&
Sells
International
,
said
he
believes
the
legal
action
by
the
British

``
to

''
Other
conservatives
thought
to
be
on
the
administration
's
short
list
include
Washington
lawyer
Michael
Uhlmann
,
who
was
passed
over
for
the
No.

job
at
the
Justice

,
and

The
new

to

to
established

made
by

,
which
``
opens

phenomenal

Robert

,
Convex

Wilson
H.

,
president
and
chief
executive
officer
of
this

,
was
elected
to
the
additional
post
of

The
Fed
chairman
's
caution
was
apparent
again
on
the
Monday
morning
after
the
market
's
plunge
,
when
the
central
bank
took
only
modest
steps
to
aid
the
markets
.

said
Mr.
Marinaro
consequently
has
resigned
from
those
posts

from
the

board
.
Most
notably
,
several
of
the
regulatory
steps
recommended
by
the
Brady
Task
Force
,
which
analyzed
the
1987
crash
,
would
be
revived
--
especially
because
that
group
's
chairman
is
now
the
Treasury
secretary
.
Mr.
Gaubert
,
who
was
chairman
and
the
majority
stockholder
of
Independent
American
,
had
relinquished
his
control
in
exchange
for
federal
regulators
'
agreement
to
drop
their
inquiry
into
his
activities
at
another

of
McDonald
's

who
is
chairman
of
the
company

Board
,
says
some
fast-food
outlets
``
could
be
in
serious
trouble
,
based
on
the
amount
of
discounting
that
seems
to
be
going

''
Richard
Breeden
,
the
new
chairman
of
the
SEC
,
has
n't
taken
a
formal
position
on
the
bill
,
which
would
also
require
investors
to
disclose
large
trades
and
give
the
SEC
additional
authority
during
market
emergencies
.
And
,
with
no
other
offers
on
the
table
,
the
board
apparently
felt
no
pressure
to
act
on
it
.
In
a
statement
,
Craig
O.
McCaw
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
of
McCaw
,
said
:
``
We
trust
LIN
will
take
no
further
actions
that

Meanwhile
,
in
another
sign
that
a
new
bid
is
n't
imminent
,
it
was
learned
that
the
UAL
board
held
a
telephone
meeting
Monday
to
hear
an
update
on
the
situation
,
but
that
a
formal
board
meeting
is
n't
likely
to
be
convened
until
early
next
week
.
But
the
board
said
it
was
n't
interested
for
now
.

Sales
of
medium
and
heavy-duty

continue
to
lag
previous-year

,

Michael

``
The
public
did

Program
trading
itself
,
according
to
many
academics
who
have
studied
it
,
is
merely
caught
in
the
middle
of
this
battle
,
unfairly
labeled
as
the
evil
driving
force
of
the
marketplace
.
The
group
did
n't
make
a
formal
offer
,
but
instead
told
UAL
's
advisers
before
the
most-recent
board
meeting
that
it
was
working
on
a
bid
valued
at
between
$
225
and
$
240
a
share
.
At
a
later
news
conference
here
,
Frank
Lorenzo
,
chairman
of
Eastern
's
parent
Texas
Air
Corp.
,
said
Eastern
was
exceeding
its
goals
for
getting
back
into
operation
and
predicted
it
would
emerge
from
Chapter
11
protection
from
creditors
early
next
year
,
operating
with
more
service
than
it
originally
had
scheduled
.
Analysts
have
speculated
in
recent
days
that
the
value
of
offers
received
by
the
committee
fell
well
short
of
what
they
had
hoped
,
or
even
that

company
